# Natural_selection_simulator
This project will simulate the effects of natural selection on a 3D map populated by wolves, sheeps and plants which will interact with each other in order to survive. 

## General Information:


## Practical Information:
The graphics of the simulation (including the map, the water, the animals and the animations) are made in Blender 3.0.0. 

The objects in the layout scene are animated by Python code in the script section of the Blender file.

There are two python files in the script directory. "Main.py" is the script used in the simulation, "Data.py" is an optional python file useful to visualize how wolves and sheeps' attributes vary over time during the simulation.
